          Sequential Sampling Algorithms: Two-stage Case</p>
        <p class="justify-text">Stochastic decomposition (SD) has been a computationally effective approach to solve large-scale
          stochastic programming (SP) problems arising in practical applications. By using incremental
          sampling,
          this approach is designed to discover an appropriate sample size for a given SP instance, thus
          precluding the need for either scenario reduction or arbitrary sample sizes to create sample average
          approximations (SAA). SD provides solutions of similar quality in far less computational time using
          ordinarily available computational resources. However, previous versions of SD did not allow
          randomness
          to appear in the second-stage cost coefficients. In this research, we extend its capabilities by
          relaxing this assumption on cost coefficients in the second-stage. In addition to the algorithmic
          enhancements necessary to achieve this, we also present the details of implementing these extensions
          which preserve the computational edge of SD. Finally, we demonstrate the results obtained from the
          latest implementation of SD on a variety of test instances generated for problems from the
          literature.
          We compare these results with those obtained from the regularized L-shaped method applied to the SAA
          function with different sample sizes.</p>

          Sequential Sampling Algorithms: Multistage Case</p>
        <p class="justify-text">Multistage stochastic programming deals with operational and planning problems that involve a
          sequence of decisions over time that respond to realizations that are uncertain. Algorithms designed
          to address multistage stochastic linear programming (MSLP) problems often rely
          upon scenario trees to provide a certain representation of the underlying stochastic process. When
          this process exhibits stage-wise independence, sampling-based techniques, particularly the
          stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) algorithm, have received wide acceptance. However, these
          sampling-based methods still operate with a deterministic representation of the problem which uses
          the so-called sample average approximation. In this work, we present a sequential sampling approach
          for MSLP problems where exogenous uncertainty follows a stage-wise independent stochastic process
          which we refer to as the stochastic dynamic linear programming (SDLP) algorithm. Since we employ
          sequential sampling, the algorithm does not necessitate a-priori representation of uncertainty,
          either through scenario tree or sample average approximation, which requires the
          knowledge/estimation of the underlying distribution. In this regard, SDLP is a distribution-free
          approach to address MSLP problems. We employ regularization at non-terminal stages and have a
          piecewise-affine policy discovery scheme to identify incumbent solutions used in the regularization
          term embedded into the algorithm. The SDLP algorithm is shown to provide asymptotically convergent
          value functions and an optimal solution, with probability one.</p>

          Sequential Sampling Stochastic Programming Framework
          for Power Systems (Multistage Case)</p>
        <p class="justify-text">This work is motivated by a power system with storage devices at multiple locations which need to be
          controlled at a much finer timescale than that necessary for conventional generation units. We
          present a stochastic optimization model of the power system which captures interactions of decisions
          at these two timescales through a novel state-variable formulation. The model also includes
          transmission constraints approximated by a linearized DC network, fast response operating reserves,
          and renewable generation. To tackle this high-dimensional multistage stochastic optimization
          problem, we present a sequential sampling method which we refer to as the Stochastic Dynamic Linear
          Programming. This algorithm is a dynamic extension of regularized two-stage stochastic decomposition
          for stagewise independent multistage stochastic linear programs and is targeted at the class of
          problems where decisions are made at two different timescales. We compare our algorithm with the
          stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) which has been effectively applied in planning power
          systems operations. Our computational results show that our sequential Monte-Carlo approach provides
          prescriptive solutions and values which are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained from
          SDDP while improving computational times significantly.</p>

          Sequential Sampling Stochastic Programming Framework
          for Power Systems (Two-stage Case)</p>
        <p class="justify-text">This set of work is motivated by the difficulty in operating power systems with significant renewable
          generation. Due to the intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable generation, particularly wind
          and solar, obtaining a set of scenarios that reliably capture these characteristics is difficult.
          Therefore, this work proposes a stochastic programming framework that combines optimization with a
          sequential sampling of scenarios that can potentially be generated by state-of-the-art generators.
          Our results demonstrate that when compared with standard approaches, the sequential sampling
          approach provides better solutions with significantly less computational time. We have applied this
          framework to solve the sub-hourly economic dispatch problem, and to estimate operating reserve
          requirements.</p>

          Stochastic Programming Approach for Vaccine Vial
          Distribution</p>
        <p class="justify-text">In developing countries immunization programs often involve targeted outreach services in remote
          locations. Organizations managing these programs are in need of tools which identify inventory
          replenishment and vaccine utilization plans to minimize costs and wastage while achieving greater
          coverage level. Wastage incurs when doses are discarded from open vials after their safe use time.
          The goal is to identify portfolios of different sized vaccine vials, and policies to determine how
          these vials are opened when patient arrivals are uncertain. Our approach provides tools to develop
          simple and economic vaccine administration policies usable by healthcare administrators.</p>
